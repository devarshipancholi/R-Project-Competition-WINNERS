# R-Project-Competition-WINNERS
Kaggle style modeling competition where our team stood first in the class. 
Joined 7 different datasets using SQL and then data analysis was performed on the resulting dataset of about 500,000 instances in RStudio. 
Performed 6 different binary classification modeling techniques to determine result of a particular student (Pass/Fail). 
Random Forest model was the best in predicting outcome with Accuracy of 93% and AUC of 0.94
'FinalVersion.Rmd' has the final full code of all the models we worked on
There is a presentation too to get an idea on the business case.
