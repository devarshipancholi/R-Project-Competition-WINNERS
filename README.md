# R-Student-Outcome-Prediction
Kaggle style modeling competition where our team stood first in the class. 
7 different datasets were provided across which there were important information about Student's performance across the Semester.
First, we joined those 7 different datasets using MySQL. We got a resultant dataset of about 500,000 instances.
After performing Exploratory Data Analysis we dug deep into the analysis of the given data using RStudio.
Then we performed 6 different binary classification modeling techniques to determine result of a particular student in terms of Pass/Fail. 
Random Forest model was the best in predicting outcome with Accuracy of 93% and AUC of 0.94
'FinalVersion.Rmd' has the final full code of all the models we worked on
There is a presentation file as weel to get an idea about the business case we put forward.
